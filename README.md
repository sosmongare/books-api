# Book REST API

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple REST API for managing books using Django and MySQL. The API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- MySQL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd book_rest_api
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   env/scripts/activate
   ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Configure the MySQL database settings:

   - Open the `books_rest_api/settings.py` file.
   - Update the `DATABASES` configuration with your MySQL database credentials.

7. Run the database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You can now use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/books/` - Retrieve a list of all books.
- `GET /api/books/<id>/` - Retrieve details of a specific book.
- `POST /api/books/` - Create a new book.
- `PUT /api/books/<id>/` - Update details of a specific book.
- `DELETE /api/books/<id>/` - Delete a specific book.

## Authentication and Permissions

This API does not require authentication for accessing the endpoints. However, you can customize the authentication and permission settings in the Django settings file (`books_rest_api/settings.py`) as per your requirements.
